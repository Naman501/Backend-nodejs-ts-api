# 🚀 My Learnings: Backend with Node.js, Express.js & TypeScript  

This project is a reflection of everything I learned while building a backend from scratch using **Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB**.  

It was my first deep dive into combining TypeScript with backend development, and I documented all the important concepts I picked up along the way.

## 📚 My Key Learnings  

1. ✅ Understood **what Node.js and Express.js are** and how they power backend applications.  
2. ✅ Learned how **middlewares** work and why they are essential in request/response cycles.  
3. ✅ Created a **server from scratch** using Express.  
4. ✅ Set up and configured **TypeScript** in a Node.js project.  
5. ✅ Explored how to **create models** using Mongoose with TypeScript.  
6. ✅ Handled **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** issues properly.  
7. ✅ Got familiar with **Postman** and how to use it effectively for API testing.  
8. ✅ Compared **Postman vs Thunder Client** and understood where each one fits better.  
9. ✅ Practiced **TypeScript basics** in a real backend project.  
10. ✅ Built **CRUD APIs (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** with Node.js + TypeScript.  
11. ⚡ Learned about **status codes, error handling, and response structures**.  
12. ✅ Fixed common issues like `req.body` being `undefined`.
